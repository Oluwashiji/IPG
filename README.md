# IPG
This is a website I built during my internship at Graphic Packaging International (GPI). While the company has a global site for all branches, I noticed the Nigeria branch lacked a dedicated online presence. This project provides a localized website that aligns with the global brand while highlighting Nigeria specific information for clients and partners.

#WHY I BUILT THIS 
Local clients and partners couldn’t easily find Nigeria-specific information.
The global site wasn’t tailored to regional needs.
This project allowed me to explore how a branch specific website can improve visibility, accessibility, and user experience.

#FEATURES 
This Website is fully responsive on desktop and mobile
It maintains GPI’s clean global design
It has a Simple structure, and it is easy to update or expand
It has a functional contact form that sends submissions via emai

#TECH STACK 
HTML
CSS

#WHAT I LEARNED
How to analyze user needs and identify gaps in existing platforms
How to apply web development skills to create practical, real-world solutions
How localized websites can improve accessibility, visibility, and engagement
Working on a real problem and translating design and development into functional solutions
New skills in responsive design, front-end development, and version control with Git/GitHub

#RESEARCH RELEVANCE
This project strengthened my ability to observe real-world problems, and to design practical technical solutions, and evaluate their impact. These are the same skills i aim to bring to research projects in computer science
